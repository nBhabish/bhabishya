## Why I'm Writing This

Every time I deploy a new LLM or optimize an existing one, I forget the details. How much memory does the KV cache actually use? What's the formula again? How do I profile this? These are my notes so I can stop googling the same things over and over.

## vLLM: What It Does

vLLM solves the memory management problem when serving LLMs. The big innovation is PagedAttention - think of it like this: instead of requiring continuous memory blocks (like needing an entire empty shelf for a book), it lets me split things across wherever there's space. This sounds simple but it's huge - I typically see 2-3x better throughput just from this.

The other major feature is continuous batching. Instead of waiting for an entire batch to finish, it dynamically fills slots as requests complete. Like a restaurant that seats new customers as tables open, not after everyone leaves.

Bottom line: same hardware, way more requests per second.

## The KV Cache Math I Keep Forgetting

Here's the part I always need to look up. For Llama 3.1 8B:

**Per token, I need:**
- 32 layers
- 32 attention heads (grouped query attention with 8 KV heads)
- 128 dimensions per head
- × 2 (key and value)
- × 2 bytes (FP16)

For the KV cache calculation with GQA: 2 × 32 × 8 × 128 × 2 = **131,072 bytes = 128 KB per token**

Wait, that's way less than I expected. This is because Llama 3.1 uses Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with only 8 KV heads instead of 32. This is one of the improvements over Llama 2.

**For a 4096 token context:** 128 KB × 4096 = **~512 MB**

So for Llama 3.1 8B on my A100 80GB:
- Model weights: ~16 GB (FP16)
- KV cache for 4096 tokens: ~512 MB per request
- Remaining: ~64 GB for batching more requests

Quick rule: plan for **1-1.5 GB per concurrent user** (accounts for varying generation lengths and overhead).

**How many users can I serve?**
- 80 GB total
- 16 GB for model
- 64 GB remaining
- At 1.2 GB per user: ~53 concurrent users theoretically
- In practice, I target 35-40 concurrent requests

The GQA in Llama 3.1 makes a huge difference - way more efficient than Llama 2.

## LMCache: Why I Actually Use It

LMCache lets me cache KV pairs across requests. This matters because most of my applications have repeated prefixes:

**My main use case: Extracting structured output from clinical notes**
- System prompt with extraction instructions: ~500 tokens
- Few-shot examples: ~400 tokens
- Total repeated prefix: ~900 tokens
- Without LMCache: recompute 900 tokens for every clinical note
- With LMCache: compute once, reuse for all notes

For 900 tokens on Llama 3.1 8B: 128 KB × 900 = **~115 MB saved per request**

The clinical notes themselves vary wildly in length. Here's the KV cache breakdown I need to plan for:

**KV Cache by Context Length (Llama 3.1 8B):**
- **4,096 tokens**: 128 KB × 4096 = **~512 MB**
- **16,384 tokens** (~16K): 128 KB × 16384 = **~2 GB**
- **32,768 tokens** (~32K): 128 KB × 32768 = **~4 GB**
- **65,536 tokens** (~64K): 128 KB × 65536 = **~8 GB**

This matters for capacity planning. If I'm processing clinical notes that average 8K tokens but some go to 32K:
- Average case: 512 MB + overhead = ~1 GB per user
- Worst case: 4 GB + overhead = ~5 GB per user

I need to plan for the worst case, so on my A100 80GB:
- Model: 16 GB
- Available for KV cache: 64 GB
- Worst case (32K context): ~12-13 concurrent requests max
- Average case (8K context): ~40 concurrent requests

**Other places I use LMCache:**
- RAG pipelines (same document context repeatedly)
- Chat apps (long system prompts)
- Any workflow with fixed instruction prefixes

The latency improvement is noticeable - first request is normal, subsequent requests are significantly faster because I skip computing those 900 tokens of instructions and examples.

## How I Actually Profile This

### Quick Check: nvidia-smi

```bash
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

Simple, gives me a rough idea. If I want more detail:

```bash
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.free --format=csv -l 1
```

### My Standard Profiling Script

I keep this snippet handy:

```python
import torch
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

# Reset memory tracking
torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()

# Load model
llm = LLM("meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
          gpu_memory_utilization=0.9,
          max_model_len=8192)  # Llama 3.1 supports up to 128K but using 8K here

# Test prompts
prompts = [
    "Explain how neural networks learn.",
    "What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    "How does backpropagation work?",
    "What are transformers in deep learning?"
]

sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, max_tokens=256)
outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

# Memory breakdown
total = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9
peak = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1e9
model_weights = 16  # Llama 3.1 8B in FP16

print(f"\nA100 80GB Memory Usage:")
print(f"Total: {total:.1f} GB")
print(f"Peak Used: {peak:.1f} GB")
print(f"Model: ~{model_weights:.1f} GB")
print(f"KV Cache: ~{peak - model_weights:.1f} GB")
print(f"Available: {total - peak:.1f} GB\n")
```

**Typical output I see:**
- Total: 80 GB
- Model: 16 GB
- KV cache for 4 requests: 2-3 GB (much less than Llama 2 thanks to GQA)
- Remaining: ~60 GB

### Using vLLM's Built-in Stats

```python
# After running requests
stats = llm.get_stats()
print(f"KV Cache: {stats.get('gpu_cache_usage_perc', 0):.1f}%")
print(f"Cached Tokens: {stats.get('num_cached_tokens', 0)}")
```

This is helpful to see how much of the allocated KV cache is actually being used.

## My Deployment Notes for A100 80GB

**What works well:**
- Llama 3.1 8B: Easy, can batch 35-40 users comfortably
- Llama 3.1 70B: Need multi-GPU with tensor parallelism (2-3 A100s)

**Memory formula I use:**
```
Total needed = Model weights + (1.2 GB × concurrent users) + 5 GB buffer
```

**For Llama 3.1 8B:**
```
16 GB + (1.2 × 40) + 5 = ~69 GB
```
So ~40 concurrent users is my target for 8K context. For shorter contexts (2K), I can push to 50+.

**For Llama 3.1 70B (single GPU won't fit, just for reference):**
```
~140 GB in FP16 - needs 2x A100 80GB minimum
```

## Performance Numbers I've Seen

**Before vLLM (using HuggingFace pipeline):**
- ~8 requests/second
- Could batch 4-5 requests max
- Lots of wasted memory

**After vLLM with Llama 3.1 8B:**
- ~40 requests/second
- Batch 35-40 requests
- Much better memory utilization (GQA helps a lot)

**After adding LMCache (for RAG app):**
- First request: same latency
- Subsequent requests: ~45% faster
- Way better throughput because I'm skipping 500 tokens of repeated context


## Things I Learned the Hard Way

1. **Context length matters more than batch size for memory**
   - One user with 8192 tokens uses way more memory than four users with 2048 tokens each
   - Always ask: what's my average context length?
   - Llama 3.1 supports up to 128K context but I rarely use more than 8K

2. **Leave headroom**
   - Don't use 100% of memory
   - Spikes happen during generation
   - I target 90-95% max

3. **LMCache requires shared prefixes**
   - If every request is unique, LMCache doesn't help
   - Check my use case first

4. **Monitor in production**
   - Memory usage varies with load
   - What works in testing might not scale
   - I keep nvidia-smi/nvtop running in a tmux window

5. **GQA is a game changer**
   - Llama 3.1's grouped query attention uses way less KV cache
   - This means more concurrent users or longer contexts

## Quick Reference: Model Sizes (FP16)

For when I need to quickly estimate:
- Llama 3.1 8B: ~16 GB
- Llama 3.1 70B: ~140 GB (multi-GPU)
- Mistral 7B v0.3: ~14 GB
- Mixtral 8x7B: ~90 GB
- Qwen 2.5 7B: ~14 GB

## When I Come Back to This

Key things to remember:
- Llama 3.1 8B uses GQA: only 128 KB per token (vs 512 KB for Llama 2)
- Plan 1-1.5 GB per concurrent requests for Llama 3.1 8B
- Use LMCache for repeated prefixes
- Always leave 5-10 GB buffer
