I worked on this project two weeks before my graduation and there were a lot of changes that were made on this dashboard. \n\n### About SBIR\nThe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs is a competitive program that encourages small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR awards enable small businesses to explore their technological potential and provide the incentive to profit from its commercialization.\n\n### Resources that helped me\n\n1.
