XGBoost by itself is great at picking up patterns, but when combined with PROPHET (given the seasonality parameter is turned off for PROPHET), it would be ideal at picking up multiple seasonalities. \n\n- Above recommendation is a potential method and by no means a solution. The best way to find out would be to fit the model and observe the accuracy metrics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
