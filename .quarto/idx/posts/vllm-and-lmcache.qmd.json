How much memory does the KV cache actually use? What's the formula again? How do I profile this? These are my notes so I can stop googling the same things over and over.\n\n## vLLM: What It Does\n\nvLLM solves the memory management problem when serving LLMs. The big innovation is PagedAttention - think of it like this: instead of requiring continuous memory blocks (like needing an entire empty shelf for a book), it lets me split things across wherever there's space. This sounds simple but it's huge - I typically see 2-3x better throughput just from this.\n\nThe other major feature is continuous batching. Instead of waiting for an entire batch to finish, it dynamically fills slots as requests complete. Like a restaurant that seats new customers as tables open, not after everyone leaves.\n\nBottom line: same hardware, way more requests per second.\n\n## The KV Cache Math I Keep Forgetting\n\nHere's the part I always need to look up. For Llama 3.1 8B:\n\n**Per token, I need:**\n- 32 layers\n- 32 attention heads (grouped query attention with 8 KV heads)\n- 128 dimensions per head\n- × 2 (key and value)\n- × 2 bytes (FP16)\n\nFor the KV cache calculation with GQA: 2 × 32 × 8 × 128 × 2 = **131,072 bytes = 128 KB per token**\n\nWait, that's way less than I expected. This is because Llama 3.1 uses Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with only 8 KV heads instead of 32. This is one of the improvements over Llama 2.\n\n**For a 4096 token context:** 128 KB × 4096 = **~512 MB**\n\nSo for Llama 3.1 8B on my A100 80GB:\n- Model weights: ~16 GB (FP16)\n- KV cache for 4096 tokens: ~512 MB per request\n- Remaining: ~64 GB for batching more requests\n\nQuick rule: plan for **1-1.5 GB per concurrent user** (accounts for varying generation lengths and overhead).\n\n**How many users can I serve?**\n- 80 GB total\n- 16 GB for model\n- 64 GB remaining\n- At 1.2 GB per user: ~53 concurrent users theoretically\n- In practice, I target 35-40 concurrent requests\n\nThe GQA in Llama 3.1 makes a huge difference - way more efficient than Llama 2.\n\n## LMCache: Why I Actually Use It\n\nLMCache lets me cache KV pairs across requests. This matters because most of my applications have repeated prefixes:\n\n**My main use case: Extracting structured output from clinical notes**\n- System prompt with extraction instructions: ~500 tokens\n- Few-shot examples: ~400 tokens\n- Total repeated prefix: ~900 tokens\n- Without LMCache: recompute 900 tokens for every clinical note\n- With LMCache: compute once, reuse for all notes\n\nFor 900 tokens on Llama 3.1 8B: 128 KB × 900 = **~115 MB saved per request**\n\nThe clinical notes themselves vary wildly in length. Here's the KV cache breakdown I need to plan for:\n\n**KV Cache by Context Length (Llama 3.1 8B):**\n- **4,096 tokens**: 128 KB × 4096 = **~512 MB**\n- **16,384 tokens** (~16K): 128 KB × 16384 = **~2 GB**\n- **32,768 tokens** (~32K): 128 KB × 32768 = **~4 GB**\n- **65,536 tokens** (~64K): 128 KB × 65536 = **~8 GB**\n\nThis matters for capacity planning. If I'm processing clinical notes that average 8K tokens but some go to 32K:\n- Average case: 512 MB + overhead = ~1 GB per user\n- Worst case: 4 GB + overhead = ~5 GB per user\n\nI need to plan for the worst case, so on my A100 80GB:\n- Model: 16 GB\n- Available for KV cache: 64 GB\n- Worst case (32K context): ~12-13 concurrent requests max\n- Average case (8K context): ~40 concurrent requests\n\n**Other places I use LMCache:**\n- RAG pipelines (same document context repeatedly)\n- Chat apps (long system prompts)\n- Any workflow with fixed instruction prefixes\n\nThe latency improvement is noticeable - first request is normal, subsequent requests are significantly faster because I skip computing those 900 tokens of instructions and examples.\n\n## How I Actually Profile This\n\n### Quick Check: nvidia-smi\n\n```bash\nwatch -n 1 nvidia-smi\n```\n\nSimple, gives me a rough idea. If I want more detail:\n\n```bash\nnvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used,memory.free --format=csv -l 1\n```\n\n### My Standard Profiling Script\n\nI keep this snippet handy:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vllm import LLM, SamplingParams\n\n# Reset memory tracking\ntorch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()\n\n# Load model\nllm = LLM(\"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\",\n          gpu_memory_utilization=0.9,\n          max_model_len=8192)  # Llama 3.1 supports up to 128K but using 8K here\n\n# Test prompts\nprompts = [\n    \"Explain how neural networks learn.\",\n    \"What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?\",\n    \"How does backpropagation work?\",\n    \"What are transformers in deep learning?\"\n]\n\nsampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, max_tokens=256)\noutputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)\n\n# Memory breakdown\ntotal = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9\npeak = torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1e9\nmodel_weights = 16  # Llama 3.1 8B in FP16\n\nprint(f\"\\nA100 80GB Memory Usage:\")\nprint(f\"Total: {total:.1f} GB\")\nprint(f\"Peak Used: {peak:.1f} GB\")\nprint(f\"Model: ~{model_weights:.1f} GB\")\nprint(f\"KV Cache: ~{peak - model_weights:.1f} GB\")\nprint(f\"Available: {total - peak:.1f} GB\\n\")\n```\n\n**Typical output I see:**\n- Total: 80 GB\n- Model: 16 GB\n- KV cache for 4 requests: 2-3 GB (much less than Llama 2 thanks to GQA)\n- Remaining: ~60 GB\n\n### Using vLLM's Built-in Stats\n\n```python\n# After running requests\nstats = llm.get_stats()\nprint(f\"KV Cache: {stats.get('gpu_cache_usage_perc', 0):.1f}%\")\nprint(f\"Cached Tokens: {stats.get('num_cached_tokens', 0)}\")\n```\n\nThis is helpful to see how much of the allocated KV cache is actually being used.\n\n## My Deployment Notes for A100 80GB\n\n**What works well:**\n- Llama 3.1 8B: Easy, can batch 35-40 users comfortably\n- Llama 3.1 70B: Need multi-GPU with tensor parallelism (2-3 A100s)\n\n**Memory formula I use:**\n```\nTotal needed = Model weights + (1.2 GB × concurrent users) + 5 GB buffer\n```\n\n**For Llama 3.1 8B:**\n```\n16 GB + (1.2 × 40) + 5 = ~69 GB\n```\nSo ~40 concurrent users is my target for 8K context. For shorter contexts (2K), I can push to 50+.\n\n**For Llama 3.1 70B (single GPU won't fit, just for reference):**\n```\n~140 GB in FP16 - needs 2x A100 80GB minimum\n```\n\n## Performance Numbers I've Seen\n\n**Before vLLM (using HuggingFace pipeline):**\n- ~8 requests/second\n- Could batch 4-5 requests max\n- Lots of wasted memory\n\n**After vLLM with Llama 3.1 8B:**\n- ~40 requests/second\n- Batch 35-40 requests\n- Much better memory utilization (GQA helps a lot)\n\n**After adding LMCache (for RAG app):**\n- First request: same latency\n- Subsequent requests: ~45% faster\n- Way better throughput because I'm skipping 500 tokens of repeated context\n\n\n## Things I Learned the Hard Way\n\n1. **Context length matters more than batch size for memory**\n   - One user with 8192 tokens uses way more memory than four users with 2048 tokens each\n   - Always ask: what's my average context length?\n   - Llama 3.1 supports up to 128K context but I rarely use more than 8K\n\n2. **Leave headroom**\n   - Don't use 100% of memory\n   - Spikes happen during generation\n   - I target 90-95% max\n\n3. **LMCache requires shared prefixes**\n   - If every request is unique, LMCache doesn't help\n   - Check my use case first\n\n4. **Monitor in production**\n   - Memory usage varies with load\n   - What works in testing might not scale\n   - I keep nvidia-smi running in a tmux window\n\n5. **GQA is a game changer**\n   - Llama 3.1's grouped query attention uses way less KV cache\n   - This means more concurrent users or longer contexts\n\n## Quick Reference: Model Sizes (FP16)\n\nFor when I need to quickly estimate:\n- Llama 3.1 8B: ~16 GB\n- Llama 3.1 70B: ~140 GB (multi-GPU)\n- Mistral 7B v0.3: ~14 GB\n- Mixtral 8x7B: ~90 GB\n- Qwen 2.5 7B: ~14 GB\n\n## When I Come Back to This\n\nKey things to remember:\n- Llama 3.1 8B uses GQA: only 128 KB per token (vs 512 KB for Llama 2)\n- Plan 1-1.5 GB per concurrent requests for Llama 3.1 8B\n- Use LMCache for repeated prefixes\n- Always leave 5-10 GB buffer\n\n\nMore to add...\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Why I'm Writing This\n\nEvery time I deploy a new LLM or optimize an existing one, I forget the details.
