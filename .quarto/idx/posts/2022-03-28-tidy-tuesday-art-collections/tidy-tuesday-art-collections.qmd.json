According to Wikipedia, he was known as romantic painter, print maker, and water colorist. I am googling his paintings right now, and they are something. \n\n### Statistical Inference \n\nI am interested in learning more about the average dimension of the arts (average height, width, and depth). I think one way to go about this would be to collect all the arts available in the world and measure their dimension which is not just super expensive but also impossible. Another way to learn about the average dimension of the art would be to create bootstrap resamples and calculate their means. \n\n\n#### Assumptions:\n\n- I am assuming this dataset represents the Tate Gallery's collection of artworks.\n- Important caveat: The Tate Gallery collection is heavily biased toward British and Western art, so inferences are limited to similar museum collections rather than all artwork worldwide. The collection reflects the museum's acquisition history and curatorial decisions, not a random sample of global art.\n\nMy parameter of interest is the average dimension of artworks in the Tate Gallery collection. I will use this dataset to create bootstrapped resamples and calculate the average dimensions on those resamples. This will help estimate the uncertainty around our sample means. I am going to use `infer` for virtual bootstrap simulation and inference. Go check out `infer` package!!! \n\n\n### Distribution of dimensions from the sample\n\n```{r}\nartwork_artist_tbl %>%\n  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(height)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"#F6955E\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = artwork_artist_tbl %>% summarize(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_height), lty = 2, linewidth = 1.5)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"), \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  labs(x = \"Height (mm)\", \n       y = \"# of arts\", \n       title = \"Distribution of Height\", \n       subtitle = \"The dashed line represents the average height of art works from original sample i.e. 346.88 mm, and x-axis is log scaled\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nartwork_artist_tbl %>%\n  filter(!is.na(width)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(width)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"#F6955E\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = artwork_artist_tbl %>% summarize(avg_width = mean(width, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_width), lty = 2, linewidth = 1.5)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"), \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  labs(x = \"Width (mm)\",\n       y = \"# of arts\",\n       title = \"Distribution of Width\",\n       subtitle = \"The dashed line represents the average width of artworks from original sample i.e. 323.81 mm, and x-axis is log scaled\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nartwork_artist_tbl %>%\n  filter(!is.na(depth)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(depth)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"#F6955E\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = artwork_artist_tbl %>% summarize(avg_depth = mean(depth, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_depth), lty = 2, linewidth = 1.5)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"), \n        plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5), \n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+\n  labs(x = \"Depth (mm)\", \n       y = \"# of arts\", \n       title = \"Distribution of Depth\", \n       subtitle = \"The dashed line represents the average depth of art works from original sample i.e. 477.11 mm, and x-axis is log scaled\")\n```\n\n\nFor the Tate Gallery collection, the average dimensions are 346.88 mm in height, 323.81 mm in width, and 477.11 mm in depth. These averages reflect the specific artworks in this museum's collection. \n\n\n### Resampling\n\nI will perform a 1000 bootstrap resample on my original sample which is this dataset and calculate averages on the resamples for height, width, and depth. \n\nI am not going to get into explaining what confidence interval and p-values are. I think a good place to learn about them using this similar workflow would be [Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html). I would highly recommend checking out this book if you want to have a clear concept on standard error, confidence intervals, resampling, bootstraps, hypothesis testing, etc. \n\n#### Bootstrap Distribution of Height\n\n```{r cache=TRUE}\nartwork_height_bootstrapped_means <- artwork_artist_tbl %>% \n  filter(!is.na(height)) %>%\n  rowid_to_column(var = \"ID\") %>% \n  select(ID, height) %>% \n  specify(response = height) %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") %>% \n  calculate(stat = \"mean\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nheight_ci_endpoints <- artwork_height_bootstrapped_means %>% \n  get_ci()\nartwork_height_bootstrapped_means %>%\n  ggplot(aes(stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#F6955E\", color = \"white\") +\n  shade_ci(\n    endpoints = height_ci_endpoints,\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    fill = \"#A8CDEC\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title   = \"Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution of Height\",\n       y       = \"# of resamples\",\n       x       = \"Resampled Means\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    xintercept = artwork %>% summarize(avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_height),\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    linewidth  = 1.5,\n    lty = 5\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n  \n```\n\n#### Bootstrap Distribution of Width\n\n\n```{r cache=TRUE}\nartwork_width_bootstrapped_means <- artwork_artist_tbl %>% \n  filter(!is.na(width)) %>%\n  rowid_to_column(var = \"ID\") %>% \n  select(ID, width) %>% \n  specify(response = width) %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") %>% # generating 1000 bootstrapped \n  calculate(stat = \"mean\")\n```\n\n```{r}\nwidth_ci_endpoints <- artwork_width_bootstrapped_means %>% \n  get_ci()\nartwork_width_bootstrapped_means %>%\n  ggplot(aes(stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#F6955E\", color = \"white\") +\n  shade_ci(\n    endpoints = width_ci_endpoints,\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    fill = \"#A8CDEC\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title   = \"Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution of Width\",\n       y       = \"# of resamples\",\n       x       = \"Resampled Means\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    xintercept = artwork %>% summarize(avg_width = mean(width, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_width),\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    linewidth  = 1.5,\n    lty = 5\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n```\n\n\n#### Bootstrap Distribution of Depth\n\n```{r cache=TRUE}\nartwork_depth_bootstrapped_means <- artwork_artist_tbl %>% \n  filter(!is.na(depth)) %>%\n  rowid_to_column(var = \"ID\") %>% \n  select(ID, depth) %>% \n  specify(response = depth) %>% \n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") %>% # generating 1000 bootstrapped \n  calculate(stat = \"mean\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\ndepth_ci_endpoints <- artwork_depth_bootstrapped_means %>% \n  get_ci()\nartwork_depth_bootstrapped_means %>%\n  ggplot(aes(stat)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"#F6955E\", color = \"white\") +\n  shade_ci(\n    endpoints = depth_ci_endpoints,\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    fill = \"#A8CDEC\",\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title   = \"Simulation-Based Bootstrap Distribution of Depth\",\n       y       = \"# of resamples\",\n       x       = \"Resampled Means\") +\n  geom_vline(\n    xintercept = artwork %>% summarize(avg_depth = mean(depth, na.rm = T)) %>% pull(avg_depth),\n    color = \"midnightblue\",\n    linewidth  = 1.5,\n    lty = 5\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"BenchNine\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n```\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the bootstrap simulations above, we can see that if we were to repeatedly resample from the Tate Gallery collection, we expect about 95% of the confidence intervals to capture the true mean dimensions of artworks in this collection. In this case, our original sample mean is captured within the 95% confidence interval (percentile method).\n\nImportant note on interpretation: These confidence intervals provide estimates of uncertainty for the Tate Gallery collection specifically. Because this collection is not a random sample of all artwork (it's biased toward British and Western art), we cannot generalize these findings to artwork worldwide. The intervals are useful for understanding the typical dimensions of works you might find in similar Western museum collections. \n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)\n```\n\n\n### Libraries \n\nLoading in my go-to libraries. \n\n```{r}\n# Analysis Pack\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(infer)\n# Theming Pack\nlibrary(nationalparkcolors)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n# Styling Pack\nlibrary(reactable)\nlibrary(reactablefmtr)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(showtextdb)\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(extrafontdb)\nfont_add_google(\"BenchNine\", family = \"BenchNine\")\nshowtext_auto()\n```\n\n\n### Data\n\n```{r}\nartwork <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-12/artwork.csv')\nartists <- readr::read_csv(\"https://github.com/tategallery/collection/raw/master/artist_data.csv\")\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nartwork_artist_tbl <- artwork %>% \n  left_join(artists, by = c(\"artist\" = \"name\"), suffix = c(\"\", \"_ar_df\")) %>% \n  separate(placeOfBirth, into = c(\"city\", \"country\"), sep = \", \", extra = \"merge\")\nartwork_artist_tbl %>% \n  filter(!is.na(country)) %>% \n  count(country, sort = T) %>% \n  reactable::reactable(\n    theme = espn(font_size = 12, centered = TRUE), \n    \n    columns = list(\n      \n      country = colDef(name = \"Country\", align = \"center\"),\n      n       = colDef(name = \"No. of Occurrences\", align = \"center\")\n      \n    )\n  )\n```\n\nTate Art Museum is a museum based in the United Kingdom, so I am not really surprised to see the UK arts being reported more frequently in this dataset. \n\n```{r}\nartwork_artist_tbl %>% \n  count(country, artist, sort = T) |> \n  reactable(\n    theme = espn(font_size = 12), \n    \n    columns = list(\n      country = colDef(name = \"Country\", align = \"center\"), \n      \n      artist = colDef(name = \"Artist\", align = \"center\"), \n      \n      n      = colDef(name = \"No. of Occurrences\", align = \"center\")\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nA lot of the United Kingdom's records in this dataset comes from Turner, Joseph Mallord William.
