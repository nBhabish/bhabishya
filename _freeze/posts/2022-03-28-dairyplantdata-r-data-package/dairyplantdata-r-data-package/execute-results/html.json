It was also built to remove the hassle of searching datasets in some corner of our computer. \n\nI personally did not want to go through multiple folders searching for a dataset, so I was more motivated to build this into a data package. \n\n- Learn More: [Economic Impact of Dairy Processing Expansion in Nebraska](https://farm.unl.edu/documents/dairy/economic-impact-dairy-processing-expansion-may-3-2021.pdf)\n\n- You can access the usage information here: [dairyplantdata](https://nbhabish.github.io/dairyplantdata/reference/dairy_plant_data.html)\n\n![](pkgdown.png)\n\n# How to use?\n\n- Run the following piece of code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.package(\"remotes\")   #In case you have not installed it.\nremotes::install_github(\"nBhabish/dairyplantdata\")\n\ndairyplantdata::dairy_plant_data\n```\n:::\n",
