<p>A lot of the United Kingdom’s records in this dataset comes from Turner, Joseph Mallord William. According to Wikipedia, he was known as romantic painter, print maker, and water colorist. I am googling his paintings right now, and they are something.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-inference">Statistical Inference</h3>
<p>I am interested in learning more about the average dimension of the arts (average height, width, and depth). I think one way to go about this would be to collect all the arts available in the world and measure their dimension which is not just super expensive but also impossible. Another way to learn about the average dimension of the art would be to create bootstrap resamples and calculate their means.</p>

<ul>
<li>I am assuming this dataset to be randomly sampled, so that any inference made using this sample can be generalized.</li>
<li>I am assuming this dataset to be representative of all of the art works around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>My population parameter of interest is the average dimension of an art which is unknown. However, I have this dataset as a sample. I am going to consider using this sample to create bootstrapped resamples and calculate the average dimension on those bootstrapped resamples. In order to proceed ahead, I am going to use <code>infer</code> for virtual bootstrap simulation and inference. Go check out <code>infer</code> package!!!</p>

<p>Since, I have assumed this dataset to be representative of all art works around the world. I think a good starting point to think of average dimension would be to calculate the averages from this dataset which is 346.88 mm in height, 323.81 mm in width, and 477.11 mm in depth.</p>

<section id="resampling" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="resampling">Resampling</h3>
<p>I will perform a 1000 bootstrap resample on my original sample which is this dataset and calculate averages on the resamples for height, width, and depth.</p>
<p>I am not going to get into explaining what confidence interval and p-values are. I think a good place to learn about them using this similar workflow would be <a href="https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html">Statistical Inference via Data Science</a>. I would highly recommend checking out this book if you want to have a clear concept on standard error, confidence intervals, resampling, bootstraps, hypothesis testing, etc.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>From the simulated plots above, we can see that if we were to repeat the same sampling procedure a large number of times, we expect about 95% of the intervals to capture the value of the true population parameter. In this case, we can see our original sample mean is captured in the 95% confidence interval (percentile method).</p>
